JavaScript ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced a range of new features that make coding in JavaScript more powerful and easier. This guide will walk you through some of the key features of ES6 and how they can improve your coding practices.

## Key Features of ES6

### 1. Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions and resolve some issues with the `this` keyword.

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5

// Example with multiple lines
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  const result = a * b;
  return result;
};
console.log(multiply(4, 5)); // 20
