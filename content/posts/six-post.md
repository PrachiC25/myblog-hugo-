CSS Grid Layout is a powerful tool for creating complex web layouts with ease. It provides a two-dimensional grid-based approach, allowing for precise control over layout and positioning.

## Key Features of CSS Grid

### 1. Grid Container and Items

Define a grid container using `display: grid` and place grid items inside it. The grid container manages the layout of its child items.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
}
.item {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
